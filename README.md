# Amazon CloudWatch
- Amazon CloudWAtch is a monitoring and observation service that is built for DevOps Engineers, developers, security engineers and IT managers.
- CloudWatch provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, and optimize resource utilization. You get a unified view of operational health.

### What problem does CloudWatch solve?
Amazon CloudWatch solves the problem of responding to events and alarms, as they occur in your architecture. 
- Amazon CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrices, and events. It provides you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers.
- You can use CloudWatch to detect anomalous behaviour in your environments, set alarms, and visualize logs and metrics side by side. Use it to take automated actions, toubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applicatipns running smoothly.

### Benefits of CloudWatch
- You can use CloudWatch to collect metrics and logs from all your AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers. You can monitor them from one platform.
- You can use CloudWatch to maintain visibility across your services, applications, and infrastructure, so you can visualize key metrics like CPU utilization and memory.
- You can use CloudWatch to set alarms and take automated actions. It frees up important resources so you can focus on adding business value.

### How can I architect a cloud solution using CloudWatch?
We can architect a solution by using Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the CPU utilization and take action.
